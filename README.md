# rust_vectorizer
Practice Rust by making Vectorizers

Rust implementation of CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer using the scikit-learn version as a reference. 

The codes as of now are not optimized at all and it's still in the primitive phase of implementation, as I learn how to code in Rust language.
